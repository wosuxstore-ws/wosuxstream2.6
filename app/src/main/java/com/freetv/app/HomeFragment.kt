/**
 * The start screen (Phase 20): wordmark + "All channels" button on top, then the hero banner (Phase 22) and rows of channels (HomeAdapter).
 * Rows and hero are built by RowBuilder on Dispatchers.Default every time the shared MainViewModel.channels changes,
 * and again after a favorite changed here or in the player, or after a channel was watched (Phase 25: "Continue watching").
 *
 * Phase 29: after the rows are built, the first 8 channels of the first 5 rows are tested in the background (vm.checkAhead). While the
 * screen is STARTED, a change of HealthStore.version redraws the cards (dimmed dead channels) and rebuilds the rows, at most once per 2 s.
 *
 * Phase 32: the settings of Prefs are applied. Prefs.hideDead is passed to RowBuilder.build (dead channels are left out of the rows),
 * and the background check (vm.checkAhead) only starts while Prefs.autoCheck is on. A change made in the Settings tab is picked up
 * when Home is shown again.
 *
 * Phase 41: while the source is the start source "Sports + Pakistan" (Sources.HOME), the rows are built with homeMix = true:
 * the Sports row first, then the Pakistani rows, then "Continue watching" / "My List" (see RowBuilder.build). Every other source
 * is built as before.
 *
 * TV / large screen only: two rows of chips (countries, categories) sit under the header. Picking a chip loads that source with
 * vm.setSource, the same call the Source picker in Browse makes. Phones are not changed.
 *
 * Ad banner on top (all screens): pictures / videos from the user's own cPanel (AdsRepo), shown by AdBannerView. It shows what is saved
 * on the device at once, then asks the server for the list now and every AD_REFRESH_MS while Home is STARTED. It plays only while
 * Home is on screen (pauses when the player, another tab or a category grid covers Home).
